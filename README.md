# nc_imag

Draw images in the terminal via netcat!

Gone are the days where you needed to install a horrible and unusable image
viewer in your own computer. A possibly virus-infested image viewer. A program
taking up precious space on your precious hard (or solid state) disk drive.

If you've ever encountered that problem, then nc_imag is for you.

Currently we support **no** image formats. But will support some in the
future.
